# Lab 1 Setup Guide

This guide covers how to prepare your environment for the lab, specifically focused on **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.

If you are on macOS or standard Linux, most steps are similar, but you can skip the WSL specific parts.

## 1. Open WSL

We recommend running this tutorial inside a Linux environment on Windows (WSL2).

1.  Open **PowerShell** or your terminal of choice.
2.  Enter your WSL distribution:
    ```bash
    wsl
    ```
    *(If this command fails, you may need to install WSL by running `wsl --install` in an Administrator PowerShell and restarting).*

3.  Navigate to your project folder. Note that your Windows drives are mounted at `/mnt/`.
    ```bash
    # Example: If project is in D:\Projects\tutorials
    cd /mnt/d/Projects/tutorials
    ```

## 2. Install System Dependencies

In a fresh WSL installation, you might be missing Python or other basics.

1.  **Update Package Lists**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

2.  **Install Python & Pip**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip
    ```

3.  **Install Unzip & Build Tools** (often needed for extensions):
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y unzip build-essential
    ```

## 3. Install Node.js

The tutorial uses TypeScript tools, so we need Node.js. We recommend using `nvm` (Node Version Manager).

1.  **Install nvm**:
    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
    ```

2.  **Activate nvm** (or close and reopen terminal):
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

3.  **Install Node**:
    ```bash
    nvm install --lts
    ```

4.  **Verify**:
    ```bash
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```

## 4. Install Ollama

The Agent needs a brain. We use Ollama to run Llama 3.1 locally.

1.  **Install**:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
    ```

2.  **Start Server**:
    ```bash
    ollama serve &
    ```
    *(If it says "address already in use", it's likely already running in the background or on Windows. That's fine!)*

3.  **Verify Ollama Version** (2025 Requirement):
    ```bash
    ollama --version
    # Expected: 0.4.0 or higher (Nov 2024+)
    ```

    **If older version**:
    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew update && brew upgrade ollama

    # Linux
    curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

    # Windows (WSL)
    # Download latest from https://ollama.com/download
    ```

    **Why version matters**:
    *   **0.4+**: Context caching (faster multi-turn conversations)
    *   **0.3+**: Better tool calling support
    *   **0.2 or older**: May have compatibility issues

4.  **Pull the Model**:
    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3.1:8b
    ```

## 5. Project Setup

Now that the system is ready, configure the project dependencies.

1.  **Run the Setup Script**:
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

2.  **Activate Environment**:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    source .env_setup
    ```

## 6. Verification

Run these commands to ensure you are ready:

```bash
# Should return python 3.x
python3 --version
# Output: Python 3.12.x (or similar)

# Should return a list of pip packages
pip list
# Output: 
# Package    Version
# ---------- -------
# ollama     0.1.x
# pytest     ...

# Should show the llama3.1 model
ollama list
# Output:
# NAME          ID           SIZE   MODIFIED
# llama3.1:8b   ...          4.9GB  ...

# Should run the agent module (type 'exit' to quit)
python -m src.agent.simple_agent
# Output:
# Initializing Agent...
# Agent Ready. Type 'exit' to quit.
#
# You:
```

If all of these work, you are ready to start the [Lab Checklist](./lab-checklist.md).

## 7. AI-Assisted Learning: Your Primary Development Method

> **💡 This is not optional - AI-assisted development IS how you'll complete this tutorial!**

This tutorial is designed around **AI-assisted learning**. You won't just read instructions and code - you'll have conversations with AI to understand, implement, and debug. This is how modern development works.

### The Iterative Loop (Not One-Shot)

**Critical Mindset Shift:** AI-assisted development is a **conversation**, not a magic wand.

**What to Expect:**
- **First prompt:** Gets you 60-80% of the way there
- **Second prompt:** Refines based on specific issues or questions
- **Third prompt:** Fine-tunes edge cases or clarifies understanding

**This is normal and expected!** A typical implementation takes **2-3 AI conversations**, not one perfect response.

**Example Flow:**
```
You: "@.cursorrules How do I add a file_search tool?"
AI: [Provides implementation outline]

You: "The tool registers but returns None. Here's my code: [paste]"
AI: [Points out missing return statement]

You: "Working! But how should I handle errors without exceptions?"
AI: [Explains error strings pattern from project guidelines]
```

### Why This Matters

Your AI will give answers that:
- ✅ Follow the tutorial's methodology
- ✅ Use the correct patterns (decorators, imports, testing)
- ✅ Match the project's coding standards
- ✅ Are more educational (not just quick fixes)

**Without context:** "Try adding this code..." (might not match project style)
**With context:** "According to the project's tool registration pattern, you need to..." (matches tutorial approach)

### Always Include .cursorrules in Your Context

The `.cursorrules` file at the project root contains all the guidelines, coding standards, and debugging approaches for this tutorial. **Always include it when asking your AI assistant for help.**

#### In Cursor

Type `@.cursorrules` at the start of your chat:

```
@.cursorrules

I'm working on Exercise 2 and getting KeyError: 'search_files'.
What am I missing according to the project guidelines?
```

**Keyboard shortcut:** Just type `@` and select `.cursorrules` from the menu.

#### In Continue (VS Code)

Continue automatically reads `.cursorrules` - just ask your question:

```
I'm getting KeyError: 'search_files' in Exercise 2.
What should I check based on the project setup?
```

**No need to explicitly reference it** - Continue loads it automatically!

#### In Cline (VS Code)

Cline also automatically reads `.cursorrules`:

```
Debug this error according to the project's guidelines:
KeyError: 'search_files'
```

#### In GitHub Copilot

Copilot **doesn't auto-read** `.cursorrules`. You need to manually include it:

**Option 1: Reference in every chat**
```
I'm following the lesson-1-fundamentals tutorial which uses:
- Python decorators for tool registration
- Side-effect imports (# noqa: F401)
- O.V.E. testing methodology

My problem: [describe issue]
```

**Option 2: Open .cursorrules file**
- Keep `.cursorrules` open in a tab
- Copilot can see open files
- Reference it: "Based on the open .cursorrules file..."

#### For Manual AI Consultation (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

1. Open `.cursorrules` in your editor
2. Copy relevant sections:
   - Coding Standards
   - Agentic Development Rules
   - Testing Methodology
3. Paste into your chat along with your question

**Example prompt:**
```
I'm working on an Agentic AI tutorial. Here are the project guidelines:

[PASTE RELEVANT .cursorrules SECTIONS]

My problem:
- Exercise: 2 (Adding Tools)
- Error: KeyError: 'search_files'
- What I tried: [your attempts]

Please help me debug following these guidelines.
```

### Example: Good vs Bad AI Questions

**❌ Bad (No Context):**
```
How do I add a tool to my agent?
```

**Why bad:** AI doesn't know your project structure, patterns, or requirements.

**✅ Good (With Context - Cursor/Continue):**
```
@.cursorrules

How do I add a file_search tool following the project's 
tool registration pattern? I'm on Exercise 2.
```

**Why good:** AI knows to use `@registry.register`, proper imports, docstrings, etc.

**✅ Better (With Context + Iteration):**
```
@.cursorrules

I'm implementing file_search tool in Exercise 2.

Current error: KeyError: 'search_files'

My code:
- Created src/agent/tools/file_search.py
- Added @registry.register decorator
- Function signature: def search_files(directory: str, pattern: str) -> str

What am I missing per the project's tool registration workflow?
```

**Why better:** Specific exercise, error, what you tried, asks for project-specific solution.

**✅ Best (Follow-up in same conversation):**
```
That worked! Now the tool returns None instead of results.
Here's my current implementation: [paste code]

According to agentic code practices, what should I return?
```

**Why best:** Iterating in the same conversation builds on context.

### Make It a Habit

**Every time you ask your AI assistant for help:**

1. **Include context:** `@.cursorrules` (Cursor) or open the file (Copilot)
2. **Specify exercise:** "I'm on Exercise 2..."
3. **Show what you tried:** "I created the file, added the decorator..."
4. **Ask project-specific:** "According to the project guidelines..."
5. **Iterate:** If first answer doesn't fully solve it, refine your question with more details

**Result:** Better answers, faster learning, fewer dead-ends.

### Embracing Iteration

**Reframe your expectations:**
- ❌ "I should get it perfect in one try"
- ✅ "I'll have a 2-3 message conversation to get it right"

**Normalize refinement:**
- First response is rarely perfect - that's okay!
- Each follow-up gets more specific and helpful
- Building on previous context makes AI responses stronger

**Signs you're doing it right:**
- You're having conversations, not just asking single questions
- You're refining prompts based on what you learn
- You're including specific code snippets and errors
- Your questions reference project patterns and guidelines

### Quick Reference Card

Save this for easy copy-paste:

```
@.cursorrules

Exercise: [1/2/3/4/Challenge]
Error: [exact error message or "no error, just stuck"]

What I'm trying to do: [goal]
What I tried: [attempts]
Expected: [what should happen]
Actual: [what's happening]

According to the project guidelines, what should I check?
```

## 9. Understanding the Test Data

The repository includes sample data files in `data/` for testing your tools:

### data/todos.txt
A sample TODO list file used to test file reading capabilities. Contains project tasks in a realistic format.

### data/notes.txt
A simple notes file with project information. Used for testing file search and read operations.

### data/sample.py
A basic Python file for testing code file operations. Demonstrates how tools interact with different file types.

**Why these files exist**: When building agentic tools, you need realistic test data to verify your agent can find and read files correctly. These files provide consistent test cases for the O.V.E. methodology.
