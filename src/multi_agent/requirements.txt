# Tutorial 2: Multi-Agent Systems - Dependencies
#
# Tutorial 2 uses the same dependencies as Tutorial 1.
# No additional packages required!
#
# Core dependencies (already installed from Tutorial 1):
# - Python 3.10+
# - Ollama (local LLM)
# - pytest (testing)
# - requests (HTTP client)
#
# All dependencies should already be installed if you completed Tutorial 1.
# If not, see: ../agent/requirements.txt

# This file intentionally left minimal - reuse Tutorial 1 environment.
