# Agentic AI Tutorial Series

A comprehensive, hands-on tutorial series teaching agentic AI from fundamentals to production systems.

## 🟢 Lesson 1: Fundamentals of Agentic AI

**Build single agents with tool-calling capabilities and learn the O.V.E. testing methodology.**

### Key Skills
*   Building tool-calling agents from scratch
*   Observe-Validate-Evaluate (O.V.E.) testing methodology
*   Structuring system prompts for reliability
*   Implementing the 7-step agent loop

### How to Approach
1.  **Read**: Start with the [Concepts & Guides](./lesson-1-fundamentals/tutorial-1/READING_GUIDE.md) to build your mental model.
2.  **Lab**: Complete the [Lab Exercises](./lesson-1-fundamentals/lab-1/README.md) to build the agent.

## 🟡 Lesson 2: Multi-Agent Systems
*(Available - Refinements in progress)*

**Design coordinator-worker architectures with specialized agents and message protocols.**

### Key Skills
*   Coordinator-worker orchestration patterns
*   Designing specialized agents with distinct boundaries
*   Implementing inter-agent message protocols
*   Managing shared state across multiple agents

### How to Approach
1.  **Read**: Explore the [Multi-Agent Concepts](./lesson-2-multi-agent/tutorial-2/READING_GUIDE.md).
2.  **Lab**: Build the system in [Lab 2](./lesson-2-multi-agent/lab-2/README.md).

## 🟡 Lesson 3: Memory Systems & RAG
*(In Development - Documentation and exercises available)*

**Enhance agents with long-term memory and retrieval-augmented generation using LlamaIndex.**

### Key Skills
*   RAG pipeline architecture and implementation
*   Vector databases and semantic search
*   Multi-model orchestration (Llama for planning, DeepSeek for coding)
*   Knowledge integration with agent systems
*   Testing retrieval quality with O.V.E. methodology

### How to Approach
1.  **Read**: Start with the [Memory & RAG Concepts](./lesson-3-memory-rag/tutorial-3/READING_GUIDE.md).
2.  **Lab**: Build RAG-powered agents in [Lab 3](./lesson-3-memory-rag/lab-3/README.md).

### Current Status
*   ✅ Core documentation complete (RAG architecture, embeddings, multi-model coordination)
*   ✅ Lab exercises defined (4 exercises: LlamaIndex setup → Project embedding → Multi-model → Architect-Builder)
*   🚧 Code scaffolds in place, awaiting implementation
*   🚧 O.V.E. test harness for RAG systems in development
